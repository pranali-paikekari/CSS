    <p>A C program contains one or more functions, where a function is defined as a group of 
        statements that perform a well-defined task. Figure below shows the structure of a C program. 
        The statements in a function are written in a logical sequence to perform a specific task. The 
        main() function is the most important function and is a part of every C program. Rather, the 
        execution of a C program begins with this function</p>
